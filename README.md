# NKNOWN
NKNOWN is an integrated AI in the terminal. You can customize it as much as you want.
I have created this project because I was thinking a few months ago to add an AI in the terminal and use it. Just for fun.

I know it is not perfect and probably it can be improved a lot, but my curiosity is satisfied :)

# How to run the project
1. You'll need your glhf.chat token that you can get from [here](https://glhf.chat/users/settings/api). You need an account to get the token.
2. Create your virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv` and activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate ` or `activate` in the same folder as the project.
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt `
4. Run project `py nknown.py`

Have fun and happy coding! ^_^
